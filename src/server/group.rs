/// A synchronized playback group.
///
/// The server-side synchronization trick is simple and doesn't require
/// knowing any client's individual clock: every member is sent the *same*
/// audio bytes tagged with the *same* `server/time`-domain timestamp. Each
/// client independently converts that timestamp into its own clock domain
/// (via the offset/drift it tracks from `client/time`/`server/time`
/// exchanges) and schedules local playback there — so two members with
/// converged clock-sync play the same chunk at the same wall-clock instant
/// without the server ever comparing their clocks to each other.
///
/// The timestamp stream lives in a [`SharedTimeline`]. A group created with
/// [`Group::new`] owns its own timeline (the classic single-group case: sync is
/// automatic). Several groups created with [`Group::with_timeline`] over one
/// `Arc<SharedTimeline>` share a single timeline — the building block for
/// per-device senders that must stay phase-locked while being addressed
/// independently (duck/overlay/route one member without the others). In that
/// mode the caller stamps the timeline **once** per chunk
/// ([`SharedTimeline::stamp`]) and delivers the result to each group via
/// [`Group::push_encoded`], instead of calling [`Group::push_audio`] per group
/// (which would advance the shared timeline once per group).
///
/// v1 scope: one shared PCM format for the whole group — no per-client
/// transcoding, so a member that can't take the group's format is a v1
/// limitation, not silently-wrong audio. No late-join catch-up (a client
/// added mid-stream just gets `stream/start` and audio from that point
/// forward) and no historical buffer replay.
